# browser-homepage

Cute browser homepage I started during high school. View on: https://densola.github.io/browser-homepage.

## Details

-   `./images/` directory contains a set of cool GIFs I found online to use for the page background
-   To change the background, just go into `./styles.css` and change the line (which contains the comment "Set background here") accordingly.
